# legendary-octo-engine
Generic Code Written At My Personal Laptop as part of various trial codes or in my leisure times.
The Code Pertains to C, C++, Pascal, Perl etc.. 
Folders may contain the RCS/ sub-folder as I use rcs commits too for local versions tracking and updates that I make in those files. 
I'll keep adding this README note with any miscellenious infos as we go and when even I feel any need for the same.
